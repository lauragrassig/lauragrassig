# üöÄ Expertise

Passionate about crafting interactive and intuitive user experiences, I specialize in front-end web development, combining modern frameworks with best practice design patterns. With almost 7 years dedicated to honing my skills in front-end technologies, I've led teams, designed system guidelines, and upheld the highest standards in web performance and SEO.

In my professional journey, I've proudly served as a Front-end Technical Lead as well, a role where my technical expertise met the challenges of team management. Beyond crafting top-tier user interfaces, I embraced the responsibilities of leadership, guiding my team with strategic oversight, and ensuring projects were executed efficiently.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I've embraced the role of a "content creator" within the technology sphere. My approach is distinct; I aim to offer a fresh perspective on tech, blending insights with a dash of humor.

Outside of the professional environment, I nurture a unique passion: creating "art" using exclusively CSS. This activity not only sharpens my technical prowess but also allows me to blend programming and creativity in a uniquely captivating way.
